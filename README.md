1. Nim is a strategy game in which two players take turns removing pieces. On each turn, a player must remove at least one piece up to the maximum number of removals established at the beginning of the game. Whoever gets the last object wins.
2. In this case, the program is being programmed to always win. It does not matter what you do.
3. I took this lesson from the usp computer science course at coursera.

- MY OBJECTIVES:

1. I intend to apply the things what i learn over time. This code starts simple and i will improve it little by little.
2. I just want to improve my coding skills and anyone is willing to give me tips and suggestionos to improve my code, i will be grateful.

- FIRST COMMIT:
1. This first code is composed of functions in a single class. I will implement the classes later.
